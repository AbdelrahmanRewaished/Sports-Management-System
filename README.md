.\dotnet-sdk-7.0.1-win-x64.exe
```

- MacOS:
```bash
curl -L https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/7.0.1/dotnet-sdk-7.0.1-osx-x64.pkg -o dotnet-sdk-7.0.1-osx-x64.pkg
sudo installer -pkg dotnet-sdk-7.0.1-osx-x64.pkg -target /
```

- Linux:
```bash
wget https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/7.0.1/dotnet-sdk-7.0.1-linux-x64.tar.gz
tar -xvf dotnet-sdk-7.0.1-linux-x64.tar.gz
sudo mv dotnet /usr/share/

2- Here's an installation guide and script to install Microsoft SQL Server 2019 on Windows, macOS, and Linux:

Windows:

Download the Microsoft SQL Server 2019 installation media from the Microsoft website.

Double-click the setup file to launch the installation wizard.

Select the option to "install a new stand-alone installation."

Enter your product key and click "Next."

Accept the license terms and click "Next."

Select the components you want to install and click "Next."

Choose the default instance or specify a named instance, and then click "Next."

Select the authentication mode and configure the necessary security settings, and then click "Next."

Choose the location for the data and log files, and then click "Next."

Review the summary of your installation settings and click "Install."

Wait for the installation to complete, and then click "Close."

macOS and Linux:

Download the Microsoft SQL Server 2019 installation package for macOS or Linux from the Microsoft website.

Extract the package to a directory of your choice.

Open a terminal window and navigate to the extracted directory.

Run the following command to install Microsoft SQL Server 2019: 
```bash
./setup
```
Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation process.

To configure the database server connection and get the connection string for Microsoft SQL Server 2019, follow these steps:

Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) from the Windows Start menu or from the Microsoft SQL Server program group.

Connect to your SQL Server instance by entering the server name and authentication information in the Connect to Server dialog box.

Once connected, expand the Databases folder in the Object Explorer and right-click on the database you want to connect to.

Choose Properties from the context menu, and then select the Connections page.

Enable the Allow remote connections to this server option and then click OK.

Restart the SQL Server service for the changes to take effect.

To get the connection string, right-click on the database in the Object Explorer and choose Properties.

Select the Connections page and copy the string under the Connection string: field.

The connection string will contain the server name, database name, and other connection parameters necessary to connect to the database from a client application. Here's an example of a typical connection string for Microsoft SQL Server 2019:
```bash
Data Source=myServerName;Initial Catalog=myDataBase;Integrated Security=True;
```




3- <b>Clone the Repository</b> 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbdelrahmanRewaished/Sports-Management-System
```

4- Restore the packages: Open a command prompt or terminal window, navigate to the root folder of the application, and run the following command to restore the packages:

dotnet add package BCrypt.NET-Core --version 1.6.0
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.RuntimeCompilation
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore --version 7.0.1
dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.UserSecrets --version 7.0.0
dotnet add package System.Data.SqlClient --version 4.8.5



## Implementation ðŸ”¨
- The Application was mainly built using ASP.NET Core Razor Pages and .NET Core Web API [version 7.0]
- The implementation was based on "Database First Approach" startegy.
The database components including Entities, Views, Stored Procedures and Functions was the first step of the implementation, built using Microsoft SQL Server and included the Different elements of the system. <br>
Secondly, reverse engineering was applied to transform all the components into C# Classes by the Microsoft Entity Framework Core, that consequently formed the DatabaseContext which controlls all the classes representing the Entities.

- System/Database Main Entities:

1) <b>System Users</b> <br>
  a- <b>System Admins</b> <br>
  b- <b>Sports Association Managers</b> <br>
  c- <b>Stadium Managers</b> <br>
  d- <b>Club Representatives</b> <br>
  e- <b>Fans</b> <br>
2) <b>Clubs</b> <br>
3) <b>Stadiums</b> <br>
4) <b>Matches</b> <br>
5) <b>Hosting Requests</b> <br>
6) <b>Tickets</b> <br>
<br>

- Security

Security is Added to the System to handle the following :<br>
1- The Application Authentication and Authorization based on Users Roles which implemented by <b>Security Claims</b> in .NET Core <br>
2- Password Hashing to by <b>BCript Library</b>.
